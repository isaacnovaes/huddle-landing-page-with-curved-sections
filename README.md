## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Styled Components


### Continued development

I have started this challenge to solidify my knowledge and practise the development workflow. My goal was fulfilled and I am very satisfied with my performance, because I have concluded the challenge much more faster than the time I used for finishing [my first challenge](https://github.com/isaacnovaes/huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections), [GitHub repository](https://github.com/isaacnovaes/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page). For my next project, I plan on taking a harder task so that I can improve my skills and gain more knowledge in the frontend development.
